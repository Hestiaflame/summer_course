"""Once upon a time... there was a very annoying bug that I just couldn't fix.
By printing five hundred different things in half a dozen different locations, I eventually found that
the problem with the wrong card was occurring when there were two cards with the same rank in one hand,
with the correct card placed after the card with the wrong suit. The program would go up until it saw
that right double, and then attempt to go and find it again, at which point it would bump into the
wrong double and, since they had the same rank, think that the wrong card was the card it was looking
for, and therefore play it. I got around this bug by making an index number of my own, making it start
at zero before each "for each_ in __list", and increment-ing it by one every time it went through the
loop. With that, I was able to have the index of a certain card without having the index tied to the
placement of that particular card (and rank) in the list. It just directly goes and pops whatever that
card is at that index. (The End - lovely story right? :-))"""
